Recovery codes
The below codes are used to recover your account in case you lose access to your MFA authenticator.

Save these recovery codes as securely as a password. We recommend using a password manager such as 1Password, KeePassXC, or bitwarden.

If you cannot find these codes, you will lose access to your account.
